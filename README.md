Hi! I build secure and reliable software systems using modern tools and techniques. 

I have built and scaled software systems for a large user base. I have led, developed, 
and maintained several critical features for SOC2 and PCI compliant products such as 
Nintex Workflow Cloud, Xendit Payments, and Ezypay Subscription Payment System. 
In addition, I have experience with TCP Congestion Control, NUI and Image Processing.
