### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 

I build secure and reliable software systems using modern tools and techniques. 

I have built and scaled software systems for a large user base. I have led, developed, and maintained several critical features for SOC2 and PCI compliant products such as Nintex Workflow Cloud, Xendit Payments, and Ezypay Subscription Payment System. 

Before that I worked on some of the cool stuff like Natural User Interfaces, Body Gesture Recognition Systems and Image Processing to build cool solutions. 

Also, I helped build QTCP a TCP Congestion Control Algorithm that performs better than Cubic, Bic and other algorithms.

I am just a click away; Feel free to reach out to me.
